Compilation instructions:

Linux:

First you need to build a modified copy of RDKIT which is included in the source distribution. The other two dependencies - tclap and boost
are header-only and do not need to be compiled.

cd rdkit-master
# change the environment variable below to your own location
export RDBASE=/home/igor/polymer/rdkit-master
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$RDBASE/lib
mkdir build
cd build
# change the boost location below to your own value
cmake -DRDK_BUILD_PYTHON_WRAPPERS= -DRDK_BUILD_INCHI_SUPPORT=ON -DRDK_BUILD_SLN_SUPPORT=OFF -DBOOST_ROOT=/home/igor/repo/fda/boost_1_55_0/ ..
make
make install

# return to the polymer source folder
cd ../..
# Edit the Makefile to modify the values of RDBASE, BOOST_HOME, and TCLAP to your own locations
make

# The tool should now be build

Windows:

On Windows I am using free MinGW compiler with Msys shell.
The steps are identical to Linux, with the difference in cmake command line options for RDKIT:

# Change the value of BOOST_ROOT below.
cmake -G"MSYS Makefiles" -DRDK_BUILD_PYTHON_WRAPPERS= -DRDK_BUILD_INCHI_SUPPORT=ON -DRDK_BUILD_SLN_SUPPORT=OFF -DBOOST_ROOT=C:/MinGW/msys/1.0/home/igor/boost_1_53_0/ ..
