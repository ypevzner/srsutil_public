Usage:

To get help on the command line options run:
polymer --help

Most likely you will need the following options most of the time:
polymer --do-not-canonicalize input.mol output.sdf

The tool takes two mandatory arguments - input filename and output filename.
By default the input is assumed to be MDL MOL file containing single polymer molecule.
Optional command line arguments include:

   --do-not-canonicalize
     Do not canonicalize molecules - that is, do not perform frame shifting of the brackets.
     This is most likely the option you will most commonly use.

   --do-not-split
     Do not split fragments - do not output SRUs, connections and endpoints as separate molecules
     in the output SD file.

   --keep-wildcard
     Keep wildcard atoms unmodified - do not absorb any additional atoms into the wildcard atoms ("*").

   --sru <filename>
     output found SRUs to file name - output SRU fragments into a separate file.

   --connection
     Print out connection atom numbers

   --xml <filename>
     external XML file name - for MDL MOL input allows to give an external XML file.
     Currently ignored.

   --sdf
     Input and output are SD files - if the input is an sd file containing several molecules,
     use this option.

   --,  --ignore_rest
     Ignores the rest of the labeled arguments following this flag.

   --version
     Displays version information and exits.

   -h,  --help
     Displays usage information and exits.

   <filename>
     (required)  Input MOL file

   <filename>
     (required)  Output MOL file
